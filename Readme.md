## Problem Statement 13

Given any image file input.png, hide a QR code in it, not visible to naked eyes, and generate the image file output as output.png, where the QR code image is generated by the program using the secret code user input (secret code can be any random string of length 6-14 example "my_secret") (Program A). Then write another program to extract the QR code from the image  (Program B). (Hint: Stenography)

Program A
Input: input.png and secret code
Output: output.png

Program B
Input: output.png
Output: QR Code Image or Secret Code
Partial Acceptable Solution: None
Complete solution: Expected output as suggested


## Steps to run the files :-

1) Run the encode.py file for Program A

---> For this run the following line :
python encode.py merge --input_img_to_encode="path of the image to be encoded" --output="path where you want to save the encoded image along with the name with which you want to save the image"

---> Example : python encode.py merge --input_img_to_encode="C:\Users\xyz\Desktop\images\sunset.jpg" 
               --output="C:\Users\xyz\Desktop\images\encoded_sunset.png" 


2) Run the decode.py file for Program B

---> For this run the following line :
python decode.py unmerge --input_img_to_decode="path of the encoded image that is to be decoded" --output="path where you want to save the decoded image along with the name with which you want to save the image"

---> Example : python decode.py unmerge --input_img_to_decode="C:\Users\xyz\Desktop\images\encoded_sunset.png" 
               --output="C:\Users\xyz\Desktop\images\decoded_sunset.png"
